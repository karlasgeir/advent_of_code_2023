# Advent of Code 2023 - Rust implementation

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.

I decided to take this opportunity to also try to learn a new language, so I decided to try out Rust. This is my first forey into writing code in Rust.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
To run the examples, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, please follow the instructions on the official [Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Running the Examples
Each day's puzzle is structured as a separate module. To run a specific day's solution, use the following command in the terminal:
```
cargo run <day> <part>
```
For example, to run the solution for day 1, part 1, you would use:
```
cargo run 1 1
```
